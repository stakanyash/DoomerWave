### List of changes:

- **The game is now 99% in black and white.**

- **Reworked weather post effects.** Adjusted brightness depending on time of day. Nights are dark, days are bright.

- **Reworked original soundtrack.** Absolutely all the soundtrack is translated into slowed+reverb format. Also specially for this modification were created two compositions in orchestral style, which can be heard after the end of the game.

- **Cut out all references to the joy of the main character.** Joyful phrases and exclamations that have no impact on the understanding of the story in the process of passing were cut out. Also all his lines are slightly lowered in tone.

- **Titles added at the end of the game.** Titles taken from **[Improved Storyline](https://github.com/zatinu322/ImprovedStoryline)** with permission of the author.
