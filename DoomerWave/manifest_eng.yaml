  Doomer Wave is a mod aimed at changing the game atmosphere to a depressing side. The plot remains original and its narration is not changed in any way.

  The interface and maps, compared to the original game - black and white, soundtrack in slowed + reverb format, darker nights, as well as the main character has no joyful phrases and exclamations.
